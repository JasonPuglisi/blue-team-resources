# Scripts

These are general scripts that can be adapted to fit different competition
environments. Some may not be suitable for certain environments and time
constraints. Check the description and notes at the beginning of each script
to understand the functions and risks before running.

Check the test information at the beginning of each script to see if each
script has been tested with your operating system. Scripts may work on
similar operating systems or versions with minor modifications or none at all.

If you cannot run a script, make sure it's executable with `chmod +x <file>`.

Note that scripts contain little to no error checking, and using invalid
arguments where arguments are required may create unexpected results. Be sure
to check usage examples before running, and verify results (hopefully the
script will present the results for you to verify).
